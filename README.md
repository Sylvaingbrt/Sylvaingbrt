- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sylvaingbrt
- 👀 I’m interested in development of human-computer interactions, new technologies, virtual and augmented reality, serious games and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, Unrela Engine, C++, C#, machine learning, music making and photoshop. To be precise I am currently working on three prototypes: a grid combat system game, a reigns like game and a vampire survivor game, that you can find on itch (https://shagar220.itch.io/) or on my website (https://shagar-den.github.io/)
- 📫 How to reach me: mail to sylvgabo@gmail.com
